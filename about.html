      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Student Voices is the product of HCPSS school leaders and curriculum writers who were looking for a new, innovative way for students to have their voices heard. The overall goal is to provide a place for stories to exist that are unique to HCPSS students, giving other students, community members, and the larger HCPSS community insight into our diverse student population.</p>

      <p>Submitted stories are showcased on this site in a variety of different formats, and is encouraged to be shared on social media and student blogs. All content is created by students, prompted by questions to create a conversation about a particular topic. The current question is highlighted on the homepage of the student voices site, and all previous questions are archived for future viewers. </p>

      <p>This project is the first of it’s kind at HCPSS, and we hope it will continue for many years to come. </p>
