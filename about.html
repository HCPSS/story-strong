      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>StoryStrong taps into the power of personal narrative featuring Howard County students and staff in order to build awareness, empathy, understanding, and ultimately - connections. Diversity of ideas, diversity of backgrounds and experiences, and diversity of purpose and drive are common themes amplified across the HCPSS community.</p>
      <p>The ultimate purpose of StoryStrong is to unify people to enact positive change and shift cultures by building an environment of sharing, empathy and cultural awareness in our communities and classrooms. Meanwhile, students are building communications and self-advocacy; life-ready skills that they will carry with them after graduation from high school.</p>
