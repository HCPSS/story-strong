The Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) continued its innovative teacher preparation programming with an Educators Rising conference on December 7. The 100 participating students from across Howard County attended a college fair and breakout sessions, and heard from the Washington Post’s 2016 Teacher of the Year and HCPSS teacher Shalonda Holt.

The national organization Educators Rising, formerly known as Future Educators of America, cultivates highly skilled educators by guiding young people interested in teaching on a path to becoming accomplished teachers, beginning in high school and extending through college and into the profession. All HCPSS high schools offer Educators Rising Career and Technical Student Organizations where participating students have access to resources, networking, college field trips, scholarship opportunities and more. Educators Rising is one of several teacher preparation programs offered in Howard County schools.

> “There in Brazil I realized that this was my calling. Back at HCPSS, I decided to explore a career in social work and volunteer more with benevolent organizations”

“We’re seeing a budding interest across the country in getting ‘grow your own’ programs right,” said Educators Rising Co-Director Dan Brown. “With so much cooperation and support across the district, HCPSS is really positioning itself as a leader in this area. The Educators Rising conference should be a wonderful opportunity for the future teaching stars of Howard County to shine.”

“As a school system, teaching is at the heart of everything we do,” said Superintendent Renee A. Foose. “We are honored to support students who are thinking about teaching as a career and students participating in our Teacher Academy of Maryland programs. We are proud to offer our students model career training opportunities supported by great local and national partners such as Educators Rising.”

HCPSS also offers the Teacher Academy of Maryland, a state program designed to create a pipeline of homegrown teachers to fill critical shortage areas. Students in the academy, offered at 10 high schools, have the opportunity to conduct formal observations, develop and deliver lesson plans in a K–12 setting, and participate in special events and activities. Academy students can earn an instructional assistant certification and up to six college credits, representing a significant savings in college tuition.
